-- GPDB5: In GPDB6, lead/lag functions with the second parameters as bigint are not
-- supported. Only such functions with integer as the second parameter are
-- supported. So, while upgrading, if there are such views schema restore will fail
-- during upgrade. Thus, such views are non-upgradeable. They must be dropped
-- before running an upgrade.

CREATE TABLE lead_lag_tbl (a int, b text) DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY;
INSERT INTO lead_lag_tbl SELECT 1, 'a';

CREATE VIEW lag_view_1 AS SELECT lag(b, 1::bigint, b) OVER (ORDER BY b) as lag FROM lead_lag_tbl;
CREATE VIEW lag_view_2 AS SELECT lag(b, 1::bigint) OVER (ORDER BY b) as lag FROM lead_lag_tbl;

CREATE VIEW lead_view_1 AS SELECT lead(b, 1::bigint, b) OVER (ORDER BY b) as lag FROM lead_lag_tbl;
CREATE VIEW lead_view_2 AS SELECT lead(b, 1::bigint) OVER (ORDER BY b) as lag FROM lead_lag_tbl;
