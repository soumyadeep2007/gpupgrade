# Performance and Scale Testing

Inside the perf_scale directory is a simple script to generate some data.

# Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests are "end-to-end" tests that exercise the binary of gpupgrade and
the overall Greenplum upgrade process. There are two types of acceptance tests:
1) gpupgrade, and 2) pg_upgrade. And within the pg_upgrade acceptance tests
there are two sub-types: a) non-upgradeable, and b) upgradeable.

---

## 1) gpupgrade Acceptance Tests

These tests exercise the end-to-end components and features of gpupgrade from the perspective of the gpupgrade binary.

Set the following environment variables:
- `PGPORT`: source cluster coordinator port
- `GPHOME_SOURCE`: The source cluster's installation path such as `/usr/local/gpdb5`.
- `GPHOME_TARGET`: The target cluster's installation path such as `/usr/local/gpdb6`.

And then run: `bats -f "test name" test/acceptance/gpupgrade`

---

## 2) pg_upgrade Acceptance Tests

The pg_upgrade tests make use of the pg_isolation2 framework, which is a GPDB
enhancement over the pg_regress framework. The tests comprise the following:
- A `.sql` file in the `sql/` directory which is the test source used by the
test runner.
- A `.out` file in the `expected/` directory called the "answer" file. This
records the expected output.
- The `schedule` file lists the tests to run. Entries on the same line are
run in parallel.

Notes:
1. Some tests require variable substitution. For example, `@abs_srcdir@` in 
`external_table` tests. For variable substitution, the isolation2 framework
requires  using a `.source` file in `input/`, and a `.source` file in `output/`.
When the test  is run the framework will generate the associated `.sql` and
`.out` files. Add the generated files to `sql/.gitignore` and
`expected/.gitignore`.

Note that this variable substitution is different from environment variable
substitution within a `!\` shell context such as:
`!\retcode gpupgrade initialize --source-gphome="${GPHOME_SOURCE}" --target-gphome=${GPHOME_TARGET} --source-master-port=${PGPORT} --disk-free-ratio 0 --automatic;`


2. Noteworthy isolation2 framework files (GPDB source repo):
* `atmsort.pl`: Documents the diffing logic used to compare the output against
the expected/answer file. It also explains the sort mechanism used to ignore
the order of results from SELECT queries. And explains matchers and
substitutions used to perform a "smart" diff.
* `pg_regress.c: convert_line`: Defines the variable substitutions such as `@abs_srcdir@`.
* `sql_isolation_testcase.py`: Class-level doc for `SQLIsolationTestCase`
 which explains the syntax extensions the isolation2 framework provides.

**Running pg_upgrade Acceptance Tests:**
1. Set the following environment variables:
- `PGPORT`: source cluster coordinator port
- `GPHOME_SOURCE`: The source cluster's installation path such as `/usr/local/gpdb5`.
- `GPHOME_TARGET`: The target cluster's installation path such as `/usr/local/gpdb6`.
- `ISOLATION2_PATH`: The path to the target gpdb version's pg_isolation2 binary
  such as `~/workspace/gpdb6/src/test/regress`.
2. Run the tests:
   * **Entire suite**: `bats test/acceptance/pg_upgrade/pg_upgrade.bats`
   * **Non-upgradeable tests**: `bats -f "pg_upgrade --check detects non-upgradeable objects" test/acceptance/pg_upgrade/pg_upgrade.bats`
   * **Upgradeable tests**: `bats -f "pg_upgrade upgradeable tests" test/acceptance/pg_upgrade/pg_upgrade.bats`
   * **Focused non-upgradeable tests**: Set the environment variable
     `NON_UPGRADEABLE_TESTS` to a space separated list of tests before running
     bats. For instance:
     ```
     NON_UPGRADEABLE_TESTS="indexes large_objects" bats -f "pg_upgrade --check detects non-upgradeable objects" test/acceptance/pg_upgrade/pg_upgrade.bats
     ```
   * **Focused upgradeable tests**: Set the environment variable `UPGRADEABLE_TESTS`
     to a space separated list of tests before running bats. For instance:
     ```
     UPGRADEABLE_TESTS="ao_table aoco_table" bats -f "pg_upgrade upgradeable tests" test/acceptance/pg_upgrade/pg_upgrade.bats
     ```
### pg_upgrade: non-upgradeable tests (negative tests)

The pg_upgrade non-upgradeable acceptance tests are negative tests. They assert
that `pg_upgrade --check` correctly detects non-upgradeable objects. They also
provide a way to vet the workarounds we provide to customers to resolve such
bad objects.

The general work flow for each test is:
- Create the non-upgradeable objects and any related upgradeable objects.
- Run gpupgrade initialize which calls `pg_upgrade --check`.
- Assert that the non-upgradeable objects have been flagged. This can be
verified by looking at the .txt files generated by `pg_upgrade --check`.
- Resolve the non-upgradeable objects by performing the customer workarounds as
described in the [documentation](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/upgrade/1-0/gpupgrade_initialize_checks.html).
Ensure tests are self-contained by resolving the non-upgradeable objects, and
enabling subsequent tests to not detect them.

Notes:
- **Only** drop the non-upgradeable objects and not the associated
upgradeable parts. For e.g., given a partition table with non-upgradeable indexes,
one only drops the indexes rather than the entire table. This enables the tests 
to be as close to the customer workflow as possible.
- As opposed to the postgres pg_regress tests these non-upgradeable tests are
*not* order dependent. Also, the non-upgradeable tests *cannot* be run in
parallel as opposed to upgradeable tests.
- The first test in the schedule will take longer than the subsquent tests since
they will skip many of the `gpupgrade initialize` substeps which were already run.
- Note, the pg_regress framework gives us smart diffs. Specifically, the output
from `SELECT` queries don't require an `ORDER BY` for deterministic output
comparison. See atmsort.pl in the gpdb repo for details. However, the framework
will *not* sort the output of shell commands such as `! cat .. ;`. An explicit
sort will have to be provided such as `! cat .. | sort ;`.


### pg_upgrade: upgradeable tests (positive tests)

The pg_upgrade upgradeable acceptance tests are positive tests. They assert
that interesting objects can be successfully upgraded by gpupgrade.

The upgradeable tests create the objects in the source cluster using
`source_cluster_regress/`, and assert they have been upgraded using
`target_cluster_regress/`.

The test framework executes the following steps:
- Runs all the tests in `source_cluster_regress/upgradeable_source_schedule`
to create all the upgradeable objects in the source cluster.
- Upgrades the cluster with `gpupgrade initialize` and `gpupgrade execute`.
- Runs all the tests in `target_cluster_regress/upgradeable_target_schedule` to
validate that all the upgradeable objects created in the source cluster have
been upgraded successfully in the target cluster.

Notes:
- The majority of the upgradeable tests *can* be run in  parallel as opposed to
non-upgradeable tests.
